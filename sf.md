## Alpha Team

The first one is obviously Bobby Draper from "The Expanse" (she da boss!)

Then we have a certain A. Burton - no idea who that is, followed by a certain G. Ackbar. 



As forth, somebody I know: Duncan Idaho from Dune:

5th is D. Quaid. I've got know idea, but I believe, there's an actor with this name.

The 6th, I believe, is Alex Rogan from some very old SF film "The last Starfighter"

7: David Bowman from 2001:

9: C. Shepard sounds terribly familiar, but I can't pin him or her down.

10: E. Buck is also unknown to me

## Bravo Team

The first two, K. Garruty and H. Ochiai are unknowm two me.

3 - 6 were easy for me:

Ellen Ripley from Alien

![Alien&quot;-Update: Ripley kehrt zurück und bekommt das Ende das ihr zusteht](https://www.filmfutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/latest.jpg)

and Jeanette Vázquez from Aliens

![Dante Rants: &quot;Bad Mamma Jamma&quot;: Jenette Goldstein | Alien](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/28/6c/3c286c620a476767f671b824634febfc.jpg)

We continue with Dwayne Hicks, also from the Aliens team:

and also William Hudson:

7, I wouldn't hav known, if I hadn't just seen an analysis of the film (which I don't like that much):

Joseph Cooper from Interstellar

![Interstellar&quot; von Christopher Nolan: Das Rätsel der Zeit - Kultur -  Tagesspiegel](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/images/interstellar-neu_dpa/10940502/2-format43.jpg)



8 is from a classic: Rick Deckard from Blade Runner

The last two, J. Anderton and J. O'Neil, I don't know.

## Charly Team

The first, R. Levine is unknown to me, again, but the 2nd, I know:

Johnny Rico from Starship Troopers:

3 is funny Lone Starr from Spaceballs (I love that film)

4 is finally a woman again: Kara Thrace from Galactica:

![Revisiting the Death of Kara Thrace on Battlestar Galactica](https://tvovermind.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/6563-1532336916.jpg) 

and 5 again: Louise Banks of Arrival, one of the greatest SF films ever, but I wouldn't necessarily take her as a fighter:

![In Arrival, Amy Adams Takes a Listening Tour of the Universe | Time](https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/amy-adams-arrival-louise-banks-paramount.jpg)

But, when it comes to female fighters, the next one, Sarah Connor from Terminator, is definitely a good choice:

![Sarah Connor&quot;: Das hat Linda Hamilton nach &quot;Terminator&quot; gemacht!](https://www.tvmovie.de/bilder/758/2015/06/22/50790-linda-hamilton-als-sarah-connor-terminator.jpg?itok=2ApdWSdt) 

7, K. Flynn, I don't know again, whilst 8, Ryan Stone of Gravity, might be OK for fixing the injured and is also great at improvising:

![Depictions of Women in STEM: Dr. Ryan Stone - Westcoast Women in  Engineering, Science and Technology - Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/content/sfu/wwest/WWEST_blog/depictions-of-women-in-stem--dr--ryan-stone/jcr:content/main_content/textimage_1/image.img.640.medium.jpg/1499189746324.jpg)

Who, number 9, R. Neary is, I don't know, but the last one is probably a very good addition to any team: William Riker from Star Trek - The Next Generation:

![Here&#39;s A Reminder That Riker From &quot;Star Trek&quot; Didn&#39;t Know How To Sit In A  F*cking Chair](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-05/20/7/campaign_images/webdr03/reminder-star-trek-had-riker-sit-down-in-the-weir-2-7296-1432119672-4_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*)

I would have included Worf, too. But he's not on the list.
